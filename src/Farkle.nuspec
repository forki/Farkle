    <summary>A modern parsing system. Made for F#, but can be used from other .NET languages.</summary>
    <description>Farkle is a parsing system based on the GOLD Parser.

It is written in 100% clean and functional F# code but it is compatible with all .NET languages, although more advanced features will be only for F#.

It is available for NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher, and .NET Standard 1.6 or higher.

While some initial components are written, the real deal is still under early development.

This is a metapackage which depends on all the packages of the project. It contains no code.

10: BTW, Farkle means: "FARkle Recognizes Known Languages Easily".

20: And "FARkle" means: (GOTO 10) 😁

30: I guess you can't read this line. 😛
